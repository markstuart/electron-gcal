# Electron GCal

Unable to find a decent calendar app? Sick of keeping that Google Calendar tab open in your browser?

Then this is for you.

It's a super simple Electron wrapper around the Google Calendar site. All links in the page (e.g. in calendar event information) will open in
your default browser.

## Releases

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/markstuart/electron-gcal/releases) page to download the installer for your operating system.

**Caveat**: at this time, only Linux .deb and MacOS .dmg installers are provided.

## Development

Clone the repo and run `npm install`.

`npm start` should get the app running on any operating system.

## Issues

Please feel free to raise an issue here, or a pull request if you have something you'd like to contribute.

All contributions are welcome :)
